About athenahealth
  
  

**Our vision:** In an industry that becomes more complex by the day, we stand for simplicity. We offer IT solutions and expert services that eliminate the daily hurdles preventing healthcare providers from focusing entirely on their patients — powered by our vision to create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high\-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
  
  

**Our company culture:** Our talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our vision. We are a diverse group of dreamers and do\-ers with unique knowledge, expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives. We unite as mission\-driven problem\-solvers with a deep desire to achieve our vision and make our time here count. Our award\-winning culture is built around shared values of inclusiveness, accountability, and support.
  
  

**Our DEI commitment:** Our vision of accessible, high\-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all requires addressing the inequities that stand in the way. That's one reason we prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in every aspect of our business, from attracting and sustaining a diverse workforce to maintaining an inclusive environment for athenistas, our partners, customers and the communities where we work and serve.
  
  

**What we can do for you:**  

Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.
  
  

We also encourage a better work\-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility.

**About the Role**
------------------



We are seeking a **Product Manager with strong RCM experience and an emerging understanding of agentic AI capabilities**. You will lead delivery of roadmap initiatives, manage backlogs, and help shape the next generation of RCM workflows powered by intelligent automation.



This role requires someone who is equally comfortable with **traditional RCM processes** and **AI\-enabled workflows**—from eligibility and insurance discovery to prior auth, claims, and denials—while collaborating with engineering, AI/ML teams, design, and operational stakeholders.



**What You Will Do**
--------------------


### **Product Strategy, AI Strategy \& Roadmap Execution**


* Translate RCM and AI strategy into actionable roadmaps—epics, features, and user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
* Identify opportunities for **agentic AI**, LLM\-powered workflows, and automation across eligibility, insurance discovery, COB, prior auth (manual \+ ePA), claim creation, and AR management.
* Partner with AI engineering, data science, and architecture to align on model capabilities, data needs, and risk/quality expectations.
* Make trade\-off decisions (accuracy vs. automation, guardrails vs. flexibility) with a focus on safe AI deployment in clinical and billing contexts.

### **Backlog \& Delivery Ownership**


* Own and prioritize feature and maintenance backlogs, including AI\-driven enhancement requests and model improvement cycles.
* Collaborate with engineering to refine requirements, data flows, integrations, and feedback loops for model accuracy.
* Identify and escalate blockers quickly, especially where AI components introduce new dependencies or risks.

### **User\-Centered Product Development**


* Work with RCM users to validate both traditional workflows and AI\-assisted experiences (e.g., agent suggestions, automated reasoning, summarization, next\-best\-action outputs).
* Drive the UX vision for hybrid workflows where humans supervise or collaborate with AI.
* Conduct UAT, including testing AI edge cases and model outputs for correctness, safety, and workflow integration.

### **Cross\-Functional Leadership**


* Collaborate with Architecture Council, AI engineering, and platform teams on scalable AI design, event pipelines, data flows, and observability.
* Partner with Customer Success, Revenue Services, Compliance, and Support to ensure AI\-driven features meet HIPAA, privacy, auditability, and accuracy standards.
* Guide stakeholders through rollouts, migrations, and AI\-powered workflow transformations.

### **RCM Workflow Expertise Enhanced by AI**


* Understand end\-to\-end RCM processes (eligibility, discovery, COB, PA, claims, payments, denials) and define where AI can:


	+ reduce manual steps
	+ identify missing info
	+ automate data extraction
	+ suggest or perform actions (agentic behavior)
	+ predict denial risk
	+ summarize payer rules
	+ generate next\-best\-actions
* Use metrics (automation %, correction rate, model precision/recall, clean claim rate) to measure AI feature success.

**Required Qualifications**
---------------------------


* Bachelor’s degree in healthcare, business, engineering, or a related field.
* **5\+ years of product management experience**, preferably delivering workflow\-heavy or operational products.
* Strong command of **Agile fundamentals**; experience writing epics, user stories, acceptance criteria.
* Understanding of **AI concepts** such as LLMs, supervised learning, prompts, evaluation frameworks, model accuracy, guardrails, and human\-in\-the\-loop workflows.
* Ability to collaborate with engineering and AI/ML teams on data flows, APIs, integration patterns, and model lifecycle needs.
* Strong communication and problem\-solving skills with ability to simplify complex AI concepts for non\-technical stakeholders.

**Preferred Qualifications**
----------------------------


* Experience in **Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management** or Revenue Integrity.
* Prior exposure to building AI\-enabled workflows, agentic systems, or automation\-heavy products.
* Familiarity with clearinghouse integrations, X12 transactions (270/271, 278, 837, 835\), FHIR APIs, payer rules, or ePA networks.
* Experience working with data scientists/ML engineers on features requiring model training, prompt engineering, evaluations, or monitoring.

**Core Competencies**
---------------------


* **Execution Excellence:** Can convert strategy and AI opportunities into clear, incremental delivery plans.
* **AI Literacy:** Understands where AI adds value vs. where deterministic rules and workflow logic are more appropriate.
* **RCM Domain Expertise:** Deep empathy for billing teams and their operational bottlenecks.
* **Human \+ AI Workflow Design:** Capable of designing workflows where humans supervise, validate, or collaborate with an AI agent.
* **Outcome\-Driven:** Balances automation goals with safety, compliance, auditability, and customer experience.",,https://in.indeed.com/cmp/Greenway-Health,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/f3f0024c19e4a85ba77d0377c24b9549,http://www.greenwayhealth.com,"Tampa, FL","1,001 to 5,000",$100M to $500M (USD),"The company is headquartered in Carrollton, Georgia, with offices in Tampa, Florida; Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; and Dallas, Texas.",,,,,,,"₹, - ₹, month"

**About the Role**


Hinge Health is a company that recognizes the value of design.

Our design team plays a central role in solving meaningful problems for millions of members managing their joint and muscle health, making a tangible difference in their lives every day.

This is a high\-impact opportunity at a pivotal time in Hinge Health’s growth — our business is thriving, our member base continues to expand, and the design decisions you make in CareHub will directly influence how we deliver exceptional care at scale.

 **What You’ll Accomplish**
